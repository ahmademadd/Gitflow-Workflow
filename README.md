# Gitflow Workflow Simulation Project

## Documentation
For more detailed information, you can refer to the ["Gitflow Workflow_Report.pdf](https://github.com/ahmademadd/Gitflow-Workflow/blob/main/Gitflow%20Workflow%20Report.pdf).

## Project Description and Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a collaborative workflow using Git in a simulated development environment. The setup includes:

- Two simple text files (`collaborator1.txt`, `collaborator2.txt`) representing collaborators.
- A simulated workflow involving feature development, integration, release preparation, and bug fixes.

Key stages of the workflow:
1. **Feature Branch Development:** Collaborators work on their tasks within feature branches.
2. **Integration:** Completed work is merged into the `develop` branch, resolving conflicts if necessary.
3. **Release Preparation:** A `release` branch is created for final testing and preparation.
4. **Hotfix Handling:** Bugs are resolved using a `hotfix` branch created directly from the `main` branch.
